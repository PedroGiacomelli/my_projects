# ANN

This project aims to build an Artificial Neural Network from scratch in C. The motivation to do it was the implementation of an ANN in microcontrollers, like MSP430 or Arduino, to detect gases.
Although the code primarily did not suit MSP430 C language, post-modifications were done to allow the implementation. The reason behind it was the velocity to code in "standard" C, and then fit it in MSP430 particularities.
